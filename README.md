# A Machine Learning Model for Air Quality Prediction for Smart Cities
## Abstract:
This project addresses the challenge of predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) to minimize pollution using various machine learning algorithms, including Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India, was used for modeling, with promising results for predicting AQI in Delhi.


## Introduction
India's industrialization has increased pollutants like CO2 and PM2.5. AQI, a measure of these pollutants, varies across locations. Data from CPCB was used to calculate pollutant-specific indexes and overall AQI. The paper outlines a model to predict AQI, focusing on major pollutants and affected locations. Sensors and IoT technology are pivotal in this data collection. Machine learning methods are used for data analysis and AQI prediction in Delhi.


## Problem Statement
* The growing industrialization and urbanization lead to increased air pollution, posing health risks.
* Monitoring and assessing air quality is essential for timely government interventions.
* This research aims to improve air quality predictions using machine learning algorithms.

## Proposed Method
The proposed method involves collecting air quality data, preprocessing it, and using machine learning techniques to predict AQI. Steps include:
* Data abstraction.
* Data preprocessing and normalization.
* Splitting the dataset (70:30 ratio).
* Feature selection.
* Training and testing with regression algorithms.

## Machine Learning Models Used:
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Mimics brain structures, trained using error backpropagation.
* Genetic Algorithm (GA-ANN): Selects optimal features for ANN, showing higher accuracy for SO2 and NO2 predictions.
* Random Forest: Combines multiple decision trees for improved prediction accuracy, used for AQI in urban sensing systems.
* Decision Tree: Creates a model based on features and classification, effective for CO2 prediction.
* Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM): Used for regression and time series prediction, showing accurate results.
## Outlier Detection:
* Identifies and handles outliers to ensure accurate predictions. 
* Cross-validation is used to verify model performance.

## Prediction of AQI:
* Uses Na√Øve Forecast and moving average techniques.
* Data is split into training and testing sets, with linear regression applied to filtered data.

## Accuracy Metrics:
* Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
* Precision: Ratio of true positive predictions.
* Recall: Ratio of actual positive cases correctly predicted.
* F-Measure: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
## Result Analysis
Box plots and linear regression graphs are used for data analysis. Data resampling reduces outliers, improving model accuracy. Cross-validation ensures model reliability.

## Conclusion
This project presents an efficient RNN-LSTM model for predicting AQI in Delhi. The model, trained on 3.5 years of data, shows that deep learning techniques outperform conventional methods. The approach can be extended to predict more pollutants and apply to other Indian cities, enhancing air quality management.
